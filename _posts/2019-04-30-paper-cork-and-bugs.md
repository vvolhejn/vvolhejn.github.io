**Play it [here](https://allemansratten.github.io/PaperCorkAndBugs/src/index.html).**

You don’t like bugs. Get rid of the bugs to move on to the next level. 

We made it for [Ludum Dare 44](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44),
whose theme was "Your life is currency".

[Here's](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/paper-cork-and-bugs) the game's LD page.
It went well considering it was our first Ludum Dare game.
I like that getting hit affects both your appearance (you lose a limb or an eye) and the gameplay
(your character is correspondingly weakened).
However, it still just feels like a vanilla [Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)-esque game.
Nothing is perfect on the first try though!

For some reason, we coded it in plain JS using a canvas instead of using a proper game framework.
What were we thinking?

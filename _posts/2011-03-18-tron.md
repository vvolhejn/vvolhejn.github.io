I re-implemented the classic game Tron to support 4 players.
We used to play a Flash version of the game at school but it was only for two players, so I decided to make my own version.

I don't know what I was thinking with that yellow.

Check out the source code and download the game as a .jar [here](https://github.com/vvolhejn/Tron/).

When I dug out this repo after copying it for years from laptop to laptop, I was pleasantly surprised to find that .jar file that I built back then still works!
I built it on Windows, later stored it on a Linux laptop and finally copied it over to my current Macbook, where it worked just fine 12 years after being built.
Java does have some things going for it.

[sinewavespeech.com](https://sinewavespeech.com) is an interactive website for exploring how human speech can be reduced *extremely* and still be intelligible.
You can find the source code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vvolhejn/sine_wave_speech).

_This post is about the live version._
_Earlier, I also made a page which uses a pre-sinewaved recording to explain the effect. This now lives under [sinewavespeech.com/explanation/](https://sinewavespeech.com/explanation/)._
_You can read more about that in [this post]({% post_url 2023-08-21-sinewavespeech-com %})._

Explanation coming soon, stay tuned! Get it?

Radix sort is older than the computer yet quicker than quick sort. Why aren’t we all using it?

We tried out a few new things in this video. There is a live-action scene, so to
speak, where we – well, everyone except me – went to
[Technikum29](https://www.technikum29.de/de/) to film a scene with a punch card
solver from 1958, because it uses radix sort.

This is our second video using [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) instead
of [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), and also the first video where we used
sounds from within Motion Canvas. It was a bit annoying to get working, and
we're seeing some friction coming from the fact that MC is maintained by a
single person, and not too actively. Still miles better than Manim though!

## Sponsorship

It's also the first sponsored video! Before this, we resisted sponsorships
because Polylog is a side project for all of us and was never meant as a
for-profit venture. It also takes some time to organize and you suddenly need to
deal with issues like how to divide and tax the money.

We agreed to the sponsorship [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) because it's a
non-profit and some of the Polylog members (Vašek Rozhoň, Richard Hladík) were
already fans.

Personally, although I don't align fully with the effective altruism school
of thought that 80KH is part of (they're too optimistic about what they can
calculate), I do appreciate the general direction and idea of the organization,
so I'm glad that we went with them as our first sponsor.

## Title change

The original title of the video was "The hidden beauty of radix sort", referencing our older [The hidden beauty of the A* algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A60q6dcoCjw) video.
We kept it for the first three days the video was up, but it didn't perform too well:

After some discussion, we changed it to the more clickbaity "The fastest sorting algorithm", and we immediately saw a spike in viewership:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/polylog/radix-sort/title-change.png" caption="Graph goes from 16 August to 26 August, change happened at the end of 18 August" %}

Clickbait wins again.

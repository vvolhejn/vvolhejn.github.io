A video showcasing a surprising way to view a certain graph algorithm.
Made together with Václav Rozhoň for 3blue1brown's [Summer of Math Exposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Qixy-r_rQ) contest. We made it to the top 100!

The animations were created using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/); [here's](https://github.com/polylog-cs/rubiks-cube-video) the source code.

Towers do all the work in TD games. But who will defend the defenders themselves?

A recursive tower defence game we made for [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48),
whose theme was "Deeper and deeper".
We've competed in other game jams too, but this was [our best showing yet](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/tower-tower-defence-defence)!
I had a good feeling about it because already during development I found myself stuck playing the game instead of actually coding.
The game manages to strike a good balance between tried-and-true tower defence mechanics
and a fresh mind-bending recursive twist.

The game also has an interesting technical aspect: the way the path generation works is simply that the start and end tiles are chosen
and then a random walk begins from the start tile, until the end tile is reached or there is nowhere left to go.
If the walk doesn't reach the end or is below a certain length minimum, a new walk is generated.
This is a Las Vegas algorithm that succeeds often enough to be efficient, and it's simpler to code than an algorithm
that always produces a valid path.

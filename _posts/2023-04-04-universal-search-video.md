Another Polylog video! We teased this one on [April Fools' Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrKlPzceeqc) with a video claiming that we had found the optimal algorithm for factoring numbers.
This video explains why that's technically true but still useless in practice, exploring the weird territory where big-O notation ceases being useful.

I used [Descript](https://descript.com/) to cut the audio as well as the video and I have to say it's really cool! I encourage you to try it out if you're making your own podcasts or videos.

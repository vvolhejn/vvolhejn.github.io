A game about the transience of human relationships.

We made it for [Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46),
whose theme was "Keep it alive".
[Here's](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/overly-fragile-relationships) the game's LD page.
Definitely our most unique game to date, it's a puzzle/sandbox friendship simulator thing.
The other games we did (up to February 2022) mostly "just" put a twist on an established genre,
but this one is harder to classify.

Judging from the responses to the game, I think we could've done a better job communicating to the player
what's going on and hinting to them what things to try out.

Fun fact: The title is a nod to a [Czech soap opera](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velmi_k%C5%99ehk%C3%A9_vztahy).

A Polylog video about the Byzantine Generals Problem, a solution, and how it relates to distributed databases and blockchains.

Unfortunately (as of April 2024) this video is getting much fewer views than most of the previous ones we made.
It's a shame, especially because it took about half a year to make.
Not that we worked on in for half a year straight, but everybody involved was busy with other things and so the project dragged on longer than we would have liked.

We were happy with how the video turned out; it's hard to say why our viewers disagree.
It might be due to people disliking blockchain-related topics, the animations, the flow of the script, the changes in presentation (there was just one scene of me talking into the camera in all of our previous videos), or any combination of these things.
Who knows?

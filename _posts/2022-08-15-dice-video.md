A video we made with Vašek (Václav) Rozhoň on making dice that can select random permutations. This one was for [Summer of Math Exposition 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZuYICAEN9Y) so we tried extra hard (well, the other Vašek especially) to make it good. It's based on research done by Vašek and Tom Gavenčiak.

This one already has an order of magnitude more views than the first three combined! Glad to see people enjoying it, I think we did a good job and I'm sure the clickbaity title didn't hurt.

The animations were created using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/); [here's](https://github.com/polylog-cs/fair_dice) our source code for the animations.

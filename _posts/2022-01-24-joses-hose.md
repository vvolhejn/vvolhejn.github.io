Oh no! There's a fire in the city and José and Grant have to save the day.
A cooperative platformer we made in three days for [Mini Jam 98](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-98-empty).
The theme of the jam was "Empty" and the limitation was "Make it a roguelike".
We (kind of) fit the theme since you have to _empty_ out the building and the levels are randomly generated,
though after the contest we realized the game would have been better off with fixed levels.

I spent a large part of the time just getting the hose physics to work -- it turns out ropes are complicated!
It now works decently well but it did leave us less time to work on other features,
which meant that the game was first playable around 1AM just before the deadline.
My favorite part ended up being the homemade sound effects we added (_thank youuuu!_).
The jam was good fun overall.

Next time I'd like to try a different engine than Phaser, probably Unity or Godot.

Living a double life must be hard. How about a quadruple life? Quintuple? Find out! Navigate all your partners through the city using crossroad directions and satisfy their needs. Beware! No two partners of the same color can meet, otherwise you're in big trouble.

We made this game for [Ludum Dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/significant-others) with the theme "Delay the inevitable". Once the "double life" idea was mentioned, we knew that'd be the one we'd go with in the end. I made the music as well, so turn up the volume!

I think we managed fit the theme well this time around, though I do wish we had made a game that has a given start and finish rather instead of the usual infinite randomly-generated game. Also, we used Godot instead of Phaser.js as the game engine, which was a good decision. The framework is definitely more mature and having WYSIWYG functionality in the editor is helpful as well. I did still get confused at times about some aspects of the GDScript language and best practices (is a scene a class??), but everything takes time.

I ran a week-long seminar on creative coding at a retreat

## Experiments with neural audio codecs

_Matěj Pokorný, Yevhenii Hohin_

Neural audio codec, pioneered by [SoundStream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312),
are now the de-facto standard way to process audio in language models.
We looked at [Mimi](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi), the

An algorithm explainer video from our Polylog channel, this time on how A\* is basically Dijkstra with some adjustments to the edge lengths.

Nowadays I'm busy with [Impromptu](/2022/09/21/impromptu.html) and [having a full-time job](https://www.lakera.ai/) and I've become less involved with the video-making:
this time, I was only the narrator and gave some feedback on the structure video. But the credits for doing all of the hard lifting go to VÃ¡clav RozhoÅˆ, good job! I was really impressed at the 3D animations in this one.

Also for some reason, it seems like I'm sick and have a hoarse voice every time I'm about to record my voice ðŸ¤’ðŸ¤’

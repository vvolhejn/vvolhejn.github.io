A map where distances mean _time_ and not _space_.
Points that are close but take a long time to travel between get pushed away from each other, and vice versa.

The map is available [here](https://spacetime-maps.vercel.app/)
and the code lives [here](https://github.com/vvolhejn/spacetime-maps).

Update: Later I also posted on the webapp [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39808215) to promote [the video](/2024/03/24/spacetime-maps-video.html) and the post made it to the front page.
I guess I should have done that sooner because it gave me useful feedback about what people like and what they find confusing.
But it only sent very few people to the YouTube video, so in that sense it wasn't a success.
Lesson learned: post sooner.

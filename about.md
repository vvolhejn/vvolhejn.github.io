Hi! I'm Václav \[vah-tslav\], but my friends usually call me Vašek \[vashek\]. Or Váša. Czech names are weird like that.

If you want to know about the work I think increases my hireability, please refer to [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-volhejn/).

For a less formal bio: I'm a Czech boy who grew up in Prague.
I've liked computers and programming for as long as I can remember.
This showed in different ways:
first I got really into competitive programming contests (see CV)
where you design and implement algorithms on a tight time budget.
Then I started studying computer science at Charles University in Prague,
where I got more interested in machine learning (like many CS students).
Now for my Master's degree I went to ETH Zürich to study both ML and algorithms further.
I'll be done in the summer of 2022 and I haven't decided what to do afterwards,
which is both exciting and scary.

I also really like music. What I mean by that is mainly that I follow a lot of
bands, read/watch album reviews and own several t-shirts with band names on
them. My favorite genre has to be [British sad boys](https://youtu.be/QZ33rSumeEc?t=46),
my absolute favorites being Radiohead, The Smiths, King Krule and Black Country, New Road.
Every now and then I have an electronic phase (Aphex Twin, Against All Logic, Jockstrap) or a hip-hop phase (Tyler the Creator, Milo).
I also play bass guitar.
With a friend, we make electronic music that I hope will eventually see the light of day.

On this webpage, I wanted to highlight the projects that I've done over the years,
especially the ones that I did for fun, without being paid for it (not that the two are mutually exclusive).
That includes games, videos, other coding projects and miscellanea.

Hi! I'm Václav \[vah-tslav\], but my friends usually call me Vašek \[vashek\]. Or Váša. Czech names are weird like that.

If you want to know about the work I think increases my hireability, please refer to [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-volhejn/).

For a less formal bio: I grew up in Prague.
I've liked computers and programming for as long as I can remember.
This showed in different ways:
first I got really into competitive programming contests (see CV)
where you design and implement algorithms on a tight time budget.
Then I started studying computer science at Charles University in Prague,
where I got more interested in machine learning (like many CS students).
For my Master's degree I went to ETH Zürich to study both ML and algorithms further.
I handed in [my thesis]({% post_url 2022-09-01-msc-thesis %}) in the summer of 2022.
After that, I started working at [Lakera](https://www.lakera.ai/),
an AI security startup here in Zürich.

I also really like music. What I mean by that is mainly that I follow a lot of
bands, read/watch album reviews and own several t-shirts with band names on
them. My favorite genre has to be [British sad boys](https://youtu.be/QZ33rSumeEc?t=46),
my absolute favorites being Radiohead, The Smiths, King Krule and Black Country, New Road.
I also like various flavors of pop. From least to most weird: Alvvays, Charli XCX, Caroline Polachek, Mat213, 100 gecs, Jockstrap, LUCY.
Every now and then I have an electronic phase (Aphex Twin, Against All Logic) or a hip-hop phase (Playboi Carti, JPEGMAFIA, Ski Aggu, Tyler the Creator).
I also play bass guitar and, to some extent, the keys.

On this webpage, I wanted to highlight the projects that I've done over the years,
especially the ones that I did for fun, without being paid for it – not that the two are mutually exclusive.
That includes games, videos, other coding projects and miscellanea.
